# F1 Re-watch Buddy

F1 Re-watch buddy is a webpage that helps you track your progress while re-watching
old Formula 1 seasons and includes a bunch of goodies to help you watch them
in context, showing you the qualifying results, standings after the race and
more useful information.

## Show me!

TBD once the page is up and running!

## Building locally

The project uses Astro to generate all of the static files. To get up and running,
clone the repo locally and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server on the port 4321, hopefully showing you the
home page of the project.
